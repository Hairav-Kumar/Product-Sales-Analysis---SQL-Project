# Product-Sales-Analysis---SQL-Project

# Project Overview:
I've completed a comprehensive SQL project analyzing product sales data with a focus on identifying and addressing underperforming products. The project implements various analytical techniques to gain actionable insights from sales data.

# Dataset
The analysis utilized three key tables:

fact_sales: Contains transactional sales data
dim_customers: Customer dimension table with customer attributes
dim_products: Product dimension table with product details

This star schema design allowed for efficient querying and multidimensional analysis across product and customer segments.

# Key Analytical Approaches:

Changes Over Time Analysis : I tracked sales trends across different time periods to identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends in product performance.
Cumulative Analysis : By aggregating data progressively over time, I was able to visualize growth curves and determine whether specific product categories are growing or declining.
Performance Analysis : I compared actual sales metrics against target values to measure success and evaluate performance across different product lines.
Part-To-Whole Analysis : This analysis helped determine which product categories have the greatest impact on overall business performance by comparing individual product contributions to total sales.
Data Segmentation : I grouped data based on specific ranges to uncover correlations between different sales measures and identify potential improvement opportunities.
Top-N Analysis : By identifying our top and bottom performing products, I was able to recommend targeted strategies for optimizing our product portfolio.

# Project Outcomes
The analysis revealed several underperforming products that could benefit from strategic interventions. Based on the data insights, I've developed actionable recommendations to boost sales, including pricing strategies, visibility improvements, and targeted marketing approaches.

# Business Impact of This Analysis

Identifying underperforming products requiring immediate attention.
Revealing sales patterns and trends to optimize inventory management.
Highlighting top-performing products for potential expansion.
Segmenting customer purchasing behaviors to target marketing efforts.
Enabling data-driven pricing strategies based on performance metrics.
Providing clear visibility into which product categories drive overall revenue.
Supporting forecasting through cumulative growth analysis.
Allowing for quick identification of potential issues before they significantly impact the business.
